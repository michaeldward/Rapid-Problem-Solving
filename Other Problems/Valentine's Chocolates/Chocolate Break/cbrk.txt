DESCRIPTION

You have a rectangular chocolate bar marked into m times n squares, and you
wish to break up the bar into its constituent squares. At each step you choose
one piece and break it along one of its marked vertical or horizontal lines,
using a greedy method detailed as follows.

You always choose the largest piece at each step, that is, the piece composed
of the maximum number of squares. If there are two or more largest pieces but
with different shapes, choose one that is as close to a square as possible.

To break a piece, you first determine the orientation of the line. If the
number of columns is more than the number of rows, you choose from vertical
lines; otherwise you choose from horizontal lines. Once the orientation of
the line is determined, you then choose the actual line to be one that breaks
the piece as evenly as possible.

How many steps do you need in total?

INPUT

There are several test cases. For each test case, there is one line of input
containing two positive integers separated by a space. The first integer is
m, the number of columns; the second integer is n, the number of rows. All
integers in the test cases are between 1 and 1000000000, inclusive.

OUTPUT

For each test case, output in a separate line the total number of steps to
break the chocolate bar using the greedy method.
