DESCRIPTION

You have a rectangular chocolate bar marked into m times n squares, and you
want to share it with your love. To break the bar into two equal parts is
not always possible if you have to break it along one of its marked vertical
or horizontal lines, when both m and n can be odd numbers. So you decide to
simply use a knife to cut the bar, along a diagonal of the rectangle, to get
two identical triangles.

Note that those squares crossed by the diagonal are shared by you and your
love. How many such squares are there?

INPUT

There are several test cases. For each test case, there is one line of input
containing two positive integers m and n separated by a space. All integers
in the test cases are less than 2^62.

OUTPUT

For each test case, output in a separate line the number of squares that are
crossed by the diagonal.
